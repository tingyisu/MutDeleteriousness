# Measuring the deleteriousness of missense and nonsense mutations using the structurally resolved human protein interactome

Scripts for building human structural interactomes from human binary proteinâ€“protein interactions (PPIs), mapping missense and nonsense mutations onto the structural interactomes, and predicting the 'edgotypes' (edge-specific or PPI-specific perturbations) of missense mutations. Such analyses allow for a comprehensive comparison of the functional implications and deleteriousness of missense and nonsense mutations.
