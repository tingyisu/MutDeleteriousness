# Measuring the functional consequences of mutations using human structural interactomes

Code for building human structural interactomes from human binary protein-protein interactions, mapping missense & nonsense mutations to the structural interactomes, and predicting the 'edgotypes' (edge-specific or PPI-specific perturbations) of missense mutations. Such analyses allow for a comprehensive comparison of the functional implications of missense & nonsense mutations.

## Usage

$ cd measuring_functional_impact_of_mutations
```
**3. Install the Python packages listed in requirements.txt**
```bash
$ pip3 install requirements.txt
```
**2. Follow the instructions and run the scripts listed in instructions.bash**
